# Horizon

## Vision
Platforms enabling efficient software development shouldn’t be differentiating, the product itself should be differentiating.

Horizon provides an open-source, robust, scalable, cloud-hosted and developer friendly toolchain for the development of complex embedded software. It provides solutions for code, build, test and release.

By shifting the focus from hardware-led to software-centric development, it aims to drive faster innovation, reduce costs, and improve the quality of software development in the automotive industry.

## Initiative
The Horizon program is an initiative launched by Google and Accenture, poised to revolutionize the embedded software development landscape.

It addresses challenges in the Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) market such as complex and inconsistent
toolchains leading to inefficiencies, high scaling costs that constrain software development and a
hardware-centric focus that hinders rapid development and innovation.

## Streams
The Horizon initiative consists of two streams: 
* Stream 1 is the current focus and covers Android Platform development (AAOS IVI, AAOS SDV, AOSP). 
* Stream 2 will focus on expanding beyond Android towards the rest of SDV, enabling cloud-based virtual development of complex system-of-systems.
