<details>
<summary><code>gh</code> CLI command</summary>

<pre><code>gh repo fork &lt;SOURCE_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME&gt;/&lt;SOURCE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME&gt; --org &lt;GITHUB_ORGANIZATION_NAME&gt;</code></pre>
</details>

### Section #3c - Create Repository Branches
Once you fork the [horizon-sdv](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/horizon-sdv) repository to your GitHub organization (as mentioned in [Section #3b - Forking the Repository](#section-3b---forking-the-repository)), it will only have a `main` branch using which you can create new `feature/<BRANCH_NAME>` and `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` branches for development purposes.   

Refer [Branching strategy](#branching-strategy) for more information.

To trigger the Terraform apply workflow, ensure you create a branch that follows the `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` pattern.
For example, you might name your new branch `env/dev`.   

#### Steps to create a new branch using GitHub GUI.
1. Go to the horizon-sdv GitHub Repository in your GitHub organization.
2. Ensure that the branch drop-down value is set to `main`.
3. Click on the branch drop down, type the name of the branch as `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` and click Create branch `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` from `main` as below.   
   <img src="images/github_create_new_branch_ui.png" width="425" />   

#### (Optional) If you wish to create new branches locally,
- First create a personal access token referring to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).
- Then refer [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository)
- [Create new branches](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_branch.asp).
- [Pushing commits to a remote repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push).

### Section #3d - Set up GitHub Environment
In this section we will be setting up the GitHub repository environment with the required environment secrets and variables.

#### Create a GitHub environment
> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub environment secrets and variable shown in this section are only for demonstration and may vary on your GitHub environment.

It is important to name your GitHub environment based on your branch created in [Create a new branch](#create-a-new-branch) section. For each `env/<BRANCH_NAME>`, you must create an environment with name `<BRANCH_NAME>` having its own set of environment secrets and variables.   
Refer [Branching strategy](#branching-strategy) for more information.

1. Navigate to the forked repository on your GitHub organization and switch to the Settings tab.
2. From Settings tab, go to "Environments".   
   <img src="images/github_create_environment.png" width="750" />
3. Click on "New environment" and name it as "<BRANCH_NAME>" (where "<BRANCH_NAME>" is a part of "env/<BRANCH_NAME>") and click on "Configure environment".
   - Example: If you have created a new branch with name `env/dev`, your environment name must be `dev`.

## Section #8 - Troubleshooting

### Section #8a - Keycloak sign-in failure
Check the below sections for issues related to sign-in after the cluster has been provisioned and Keycloak is setup with google identity provider.

#### Redirect URI mismatch
- Log-in to Keycloak and select "Horizon" realm.
- Go to Identity providers and click on "google" provider.
- Copy the redirect URI available in the google identity provider.
- Now, go to "APIs & Services" click and open "Credentials".
- Click on "Horizon" under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs.
- Make sure the URI mentioned under "Authorized redirect URIs" is the same as the one in Keycloak google provider.
- If the URIs do not match, replace the URI mentioned under "Authorized redirect URIs".

#### User does not exist with google identity provider
If you are getting the error "User <USER_NAME> authenticated with Identity provider google does not exist. Please contact your administrator".   
- Log-in to Keycloak and select "Horizon" realm.
- Go to Users, click on your user.
- make sure both Username and Email fields have the complete Email address.

### Section #8b - Missing Terraform workflow
If the "Terraform" workflow is not visible in the Actions tab on your GitHub repository,

- Check if a main branch exists in your repository.
- Create the `main` branch in your repository if it does not exits using an existing branch as below.
   - Click on the branch drop down, type the name of the branch as `main` and click Create branch `main` from `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` as below.   
      <img src="images/github_create_branch.png" width="425" />
- Update `main` branch as the default branch for your repository.
   - Go to repository settings and click on the switch icon as below.   
      <img src="images/github_default_branch_1.png" width="425" />
   - Select the `main` branch and click on Update as below.   
      <img src="images/github_default_branch_2.png" width="425" />
- Go to actions tab, the Terraform workflow should now be visible.

## Appendix

### Branching strategy
Once you clone the repository to your machine, it may contain a single `main` branch from which you can create new `feature/` and `env/` branches for development purposes.   

* `main`
* `env/<BRANCH_NAME>`
* `feature/<BRANCH_NAME>`

From the above list of branches, the `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` can be associated to a project on GCP and have its own environment secrets and variables configured in the GitHub repository.   

For development, you may create new `feature/<BRANCH_NAME>` which can be merged into `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` after code review and passing all tests. 
You can create multiple `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` branch according your needs. For example, `env/sbx` branch focusing only on IaC or GitOps, 
`env/dev` branch focusing only on workloads and so on.   

Each `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` branch can perform dedicated platform or workload related tasks. Details on applying changes are as below,

* Platform (`env/sbx`)
   * Applying changes to the GitHub Actions Workflow
      - Create a `feature/<BRANCH_NAME>` branch, edit the files under `.github/workflows/` directory.
      - Once the changes have been made, merge the `feature/<BRANCH_NAME>` branch to `env/<BRANCH_NAME>` branch.
      - If adding new workflows or renaming existing ones, `main` branch must be updated.
      - If only changing existing workflows, updating `main` branch immediately is not required.
      - Run the GitHub workflow manually.

   * Applying changes to the infrastructure using Terraform (IaC)
      - Create a `feature/<BRANCH_NAME>` branch, edit the files under `terraform/` directory.
      - You can run `terraform plan` locally if you have terraform installed.
      - Navigate to the `terraform/` directory, and run `cd env && source local-env.sh` which sets up the environment variables.
      - Now, run `terraform plan`.
      - If the plan is successful and the outcome aligns with your objective, merge the branch to `env/<BRANCH_NAME>`.
      - Run the GitHub Actions workflow manually by selecting the desired `env/<BRANCH_NAME>`.
      - The above manual workflow trigger step runs `terraform apply` which will cause changes to the infrastructure, 
      it is advised to take caution.

   * If you want to make changes to the Kubernetes Applications (GitOps)
      - Create a `feature/<BRANCH_NAME>` branch, edit the files under `gitops/` directory.
      - [Log in](#section-6a---argo-cd) to Argo CD and switch the "horizon-sdv" application branch to a feature branch in ArgoCD.
